## Introduction

C is a powerful and versatile programming language that forms the foundation for many others. It's widely used in systems programming, game development, and embedded systems. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/): The GNU Compiler Collection
- A text editor of your choice (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or [Atom](https://atom.io/))

## Setting Up Your Environment

Ensure that GCC is installed by running:

```bash
gcc --version
```


## Thank you!
